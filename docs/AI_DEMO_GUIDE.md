# AI & Predictive Analytics Demo Guide
**Capstone Defense: Government Service Transport & Mobility Management**

This guide explains how to demonstrate the Predictive Analytics feature of your dashboard.

## 1. The Core Concept
Your system solves the "Over/Under Deployment" problem by predicting passenger demand.
-   **System Data (Tickets/Payments):** Good for financial tracking, but often incomplete for crowd size (e.g., people waiting but not yet paid).
-   **Manual Observations (The "Ground Truth"):** The AI needs to know the *actual* number of people at the terminal to be accurate.
-   **The Solution:** You combine both. The "Data Inputs" form allows dispatchers to log the real crowd size, which "trains" the AI to be more than 80% accurate.

## 2. Visual Walkthrough (How to Demo)

### Step A: Show the Dashboard "Readiness"
1.  Point to the **"Forecast Readiness"** widget.
2.  **Scenario:** Initially, it might say "Training" if there is not enough data.
3.  **Action:** Explain that the system needs at least 3-4 days of data to establish a baseline pattern.
    *   *Note: I have already pre-seeded the system with 7 days of data, so it should currently show "Ready" with a high accuracy score.*

### Step B: The "Data Inputs" Form (Live Demo)
Tell the panel: *"I will now simulate a dispatcher reporting a sudden crowd surge."*

1.  Go to the **Data Inputs** form (Right side of dashboard).
2.  **Select Area:** Choose "Terminal" (or "Route") -> pick your main terminal/route.
3.  **Select Hour:** Choose the *current hour* or the *next hour*.
4.  **Enter Count:** Enter a high number (e.g., `150`) to simulate a surge.
5.  **Click "Save Observation".**
    *   *What happens:* The system instantly updates the database. The AI model will recalculate the "Expected vs. Actual" variance.

### Step C: The Forecast Chart
1.  Point to the **PUV Demand Forecast** chart.
2.  Explain the bars:
    *   **Height:** The predicted number of passengers.
    *   **Colors:**
        *   **Green:** Normal demand.
        *   **Blue:** Rain predicted (Demand might drop or shift to covered areas).
3.  Hover over a bar to show the tooltip: *"Predicted: 85, Rain: 60%"*.
4.  Explain: *"The system checks Open-Meteo for real-time weather and adjusts the forecast accordingly."*

### Step D: AI Insights & Playbooks
1.  Scroll to the **"High-demand Alerts"** widget.
    *   It shows upcoming peaks (e.g., "07:00 AM • predicted 90").
2.  Scroll to **"AI Insights"**.
    *   **Over-Demand Playbook:** Read one out: *"Deploy queue marshals"* or *"Stagger dispatch intervals"*.
    *   **Constraint Handling:** Emphasize this point: *"Since operators cannot switch routes, the AI suggests on-ground crowd management tactics instead of impossible route reassignments."*
    *   **Traffic Impact:** If TomTom is configured, the AI also flags heavy congestion and nearby incidents that can slow dispatch/turnaround.

### Step E: Route Supply Snapshot
1.  Look at the **Route Supply Snapshot** table.
2.  Compare the **Authorized Units** (e.g., "Route A: 15 units") with the **Predicted Demand**.
3.  **Conclusion:** *"If demand is 100 but we only have 15 units (approx 60 seats), the system flags a 'Potential Over-demand'."*

## 3. Technical Explanation (For Q&A)
If they ask "How does it work?":
-   **Algorithm:** It uses a Time-Series Weighted Average.
    -   `Forecast = (Average of last 4 same-weekdays) * (Recent Trend Factor)`
    -   *Example:* To predict next Monday 8 AM, it looks at the last 4 Mondays at 8 AM.
-   **External Factors:**
    -   **Weather:** Fetched via API. Heavy rain reduces predicted demand by 20% (configurable).
    -   **Events:** Holidays (fetched via Nager.Date API) treat the day like a Sunday (lower commuter demand).
    -   **Traffic & Incidents:** TomTom traffic flow + incident feed helps explain delays that affect terminal turnaround and route headways.

## 4. Troubleshooting
-   **"Why is the chart empty?"** -> Ensure you have selected a Terminal that has data.
-   **"Accuracy is low."** -> Log more "Data Inputs". The more "Ground Truth" you provide, the better it gets.
