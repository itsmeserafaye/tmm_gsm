✅ What an Operator Portal can realistically do in real life (LGU context)
An Operator Portal is not a decision‑making portal.
It is a submission, tracking, and compliance portal.

Think of it as “online counter services” for operators.

1️⃣ Profile & Operator Records (REALISTIC)
What’s in the portal
Operator basic info

Individual / Coop / Corporation

Address & contact details

Authorized representative (for coop/corp)

Uploaded IDs / documents

Real-life equivalent
📄 Operator goes to City Hall and submits:

ID

Coop documents

Contact info

➡️ Portal just digitizes this step

✅ Very realistic and defensible

2️⃣ Vehicle Registration (Record Only, Not LTO)
What operators can do
Add vehicle plate number

Upload:

LTO OR/CR

Vehicle photos

See vehicle status:

For Verification

Verified

Expired OR/CR

What LGU does
Verifies documents

Flags invalid or expired OR/CR

Important
🚫 Operator is NOT registering with LTO here
✅ LGU is recording & validating vehicle existence

📌 Panelist-safe wording:

“The portal allows operators to submit vehicle records for LGU verification.”

3️⃣ Franchise / MTOP Application (MOST IMPORTANT)
What operators can apply for
City franchise / MTOP

Select:

Route (LPTRP-defined)

Vehicle(s) under the operator/coop

Upload required documents

What they can see
Application status:

Draft

Submitted

Under Review

Endorsed

Approved / Denied

Real-life equivalent
🧾 Filing a franchise application at the LGU counter

➡️ This is 100% real-life applicable

4️⃣ Inspection Scheduling (Very realistic)
What operators can do
Request inspection schedule

Choose available dates

View inspection results

What LGU does
Conducts inspection

Approves or fails vehicle

Real-life equivalent
🔧 Vehicle inspection office appointment

✅ Very common in real LGUs

5️⃣ Violation & Ticket Viewing (NOT enforcement)
What operators can see
List of violations issued

Ticket status:

Unpaid

Paid

Appealed

Download citation

What they cannot do
🚫 Cannot issue tickets
🚫 Cannot modify violations

Real-life equivalent
📋 Operator checking records at traffic office

6️⃣ Payments & Fees Tracking (View + Upload Only)
What operators can do
View assessed fees:

Franchise fees

Terminal fees

Penalties

Upload proof of payment (OR image)

What LGU does
Confirms payment

Updates system

📌 You are not acting as Treasury, only recording

7️⃣ Notifications & Compliance Alerts (Very realistic)
Examples
Franchise expiring in 30 days

OR/CR expired

Inspection failed

Pending violations

Real-life equivalent
📢 Notice boards, SMS, or call reminders

8️⃣ Downloadable Permits & Certificates (After Approval)
Operators can download:
MTOP / City Franchise

Inspection certificate

QR-coded permits

Real-life equivalent
📄 Claiming printed permits from LGU

🚫 What should NOT be in the Operator Portal
To stay realistic and safe from criticism:

❌ Approving franchises
❌ Assigning routes
❌ Issuing tickets
❌ Registering vehicles with LTO
❌ Granting LTFRB franchises

These stay LGU officer-only or external agency-only.
