🧠 IMPORTANT: DOES YOUR CURRENT SYSTEM STILL FIT THIS TITLE?
✅ YES — VERY WELL
Here’s why 👇

Your system already manages:

PUV database (historical & real‑time data)

Franchise records

Vehicle operations

Violations

Terminal & parking usage

➡️ These are EXACTLY the datasets needed for predictive analytics.

So your system becomes:

The operational system + analytics‑ready platform

🔍 HOW “PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS” FITS INTO YOUR SYSTEM
You are NOT required to build a full AI engine for a capstone.
What panelists expect is correct integration and logic, not heavy math.

📊 Data used for forecasting (already in your system):
Daily active vehicles

Route usage

Peak hours

Terminal occupancy

Violation frequency

Historical trip patterns

🔮 What the system can forecast:
High‑demand routes

Peak operating hours

Required number of PUVs per route

Terminal congestion risks

Enforcement demand hotspots

📌 Even rule‑based or trend‑based forecasting is acceptable at capstone level.

🧩 WHERE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS SITS IN YOUR ARCHITECTURE
You simply add ONE logical layer:

Operational Data
      ↓
Analytics Module
      ↓
Demand Forecast Reports & Dashboards
This means:

Your core workflow does NOT change

You extend, not redesign
